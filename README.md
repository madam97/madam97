# About me

Hey,

I am a webdeveloper from Hungary, Europe. I am learning web programing since 2016 by using deductive learning, reading documentations and watching tutorial videos, and I am working as a full-stack developer since 2017.

Even if I know how to code in PHP and use SQL, I like frontend development more. Creating RESTful APIs is fun, but for me seeing visually my code's result is better, it motivates me. I am open to learning new things to become better frontend developer using the newest technologies.

My hobby is playing board games, co-op games are my favorites.
